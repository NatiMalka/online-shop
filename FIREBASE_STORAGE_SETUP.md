# Image Hosting with Cloudinary

> **Note:** This document has been replaced by `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md`. Please refer to that file for the latest instructions on setting up image hosting with Cloudinary.

The application now uses Cloudinary for image hosting instead of the alternatives listed below. Cloudinary provides a free tier with 25GB storage and bandwidth, which is more than sufficient for most online shops.

## Why Cloudinary?

- **Free Tier**: 25GB storage and bandwidth
- **Direct Uploads**: Upload images directly from your admin panel
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic resizing and optimization
- **Fast CDN**: Global content delivery network for fast loading
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to set up and use

## Setup Instructions

Please see the `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md` file for detailed instructions on setting up Cloudinary for your online shop.

## Alternative Options (Not Recommended)

The following options are still available but not recommended since the Cloudinary integration provides a better experience:

### Option 1: Free Image Hosting Services

- ImgBB - Simple image hosting with direct links
- Imgur - Popular image hosting service

### Option 2: GitHub Repository for Images

For small projects or demos, you can store images directly in your GitHub repository.

### Option 3: Use Public Domain or Stock Images

For testing or demo purposes, you can use public domain images from services like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay.
